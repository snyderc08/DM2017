To make skimming over ggNtuples 6 files are needed:

Skimmer.cc (the .cc code where the skimming is defined here)
Skimmer.h (header file)
Makefile (used to compile Skimmer.cc)
Submit_batch.jdl  (where condor parameters are defined. Note: you need to change the location of the runPath!!)
Submit_run.sh   (instruct condor how to run the jobs)
InputSamples.txt  (where the list of all samples are stored. More info at  snagSample.py)


—————————————————————————————————————————————————
No need to do it for current round of ggNtuple
—————————————————————————————————————————————————
Skimmer.h needs to get updated whenever there is a change in the definition of the tress in the ggNtuples (some changes might be foreseen in Skimmer.cc as well)
To get the proper Skimmer.h one needs to run the latest ggNtuple on a test sample and save the output with ggtree_mc.root.

root -l ggtree_mc.root
TFile *_file0 = TFile::Open("ggtree_mc.root")
_file0->cd(“ggNtuplizer”)
EventTree->MakeClass(“Class”)

The last command generates Class.h and Class.cc from TTree: EventTree

Now all needed is to copy and paste 4 pieces from Class.h in the Skimmer.h

 // Declaration of leaf types
 // List of branches
 // Set object pointer
 // Set branch addresses and branch pointers

Now check the Skimmer.C and decide which branches you want to save in the skimming ntuple and which to drop

Steps to skim the ggNtuple:
1) Update the .cc file and add your filtering skim
2)Compile the .cc file (just type Makefile)
3)List all samples you intend to make skim (from /Data   or /MC directory in eos area)
4)In the Submit_batch.jdl file, multiply the number of the samples to 10 and quote this number in front of the Queue

Now you are ready to submit jobs to condor:  

By running : condor_submit Submit_batch.jdl

More info about condor is here: http://www.uscms.org/uscms_at_work/computing/setup/batch_systems.shtml#condor_1

at the end you can hadd the root files
