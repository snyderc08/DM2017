Crab3 files belong in cd CMSSW_8_0_26_patch1 and follow the directions for set up here:

https://github.com/cmkuo/ggAnalysis 

The Crab is the first step in the analysis and generates the n-tuples for data and MC. These can be large so they are stored in your eos space. The extra files there that aren't in Abdollah's should be in the environment once it is set up but if not they are here.
